## Testing
I have tested the site using a mobile phone and using google chrome.

The project looks resposive when i used it on my phone. 

The sign up form works correctly and will only allow you to input and email in the email field.

The video i used also works correctly and plays on other devices. 

I ran into some bugs with the code. I was unable to get the sign up form to submit and make the site refresh. I fixed this issue by adding an action to the form. Another issue i ran into was the css was not linked to the html file and it took me a while to figure out that the files were not linked. 

## Validator Testing
The website was ran throught the css and html validator and i had some issues on the original version like randon divs and h1 attributes in a list which is not aloud

I also ran the code though lighthouse and i got an impressive result for the site.
